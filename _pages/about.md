Greetings! I am a Ph.D. student at the [UCLA HCI lab](https://hci.ucla.edu/) advised by Professor [Xiang 'Anthony' Chen](https://xac.is/).

My research interests are in <b>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</b>, specifically in modeling, supporting and augmenting human abilities in a multimodal context. 
Leveraging techniques from natural language processing, computer vision, deep learning and HCI, I create novel experiences for <b>accessibility</b>, <b>communication</b> and <b>augmented reality</b>.  

My work has been recognized by an [ACM UIST Best Paper Award 🏆](https://programs.sigchi.org/uist/2022/awards/best-papers) (2022), an [ED Rice Outstanding Master Student Award 🎓 ](https://samueli.ucla.edu/2023-samueli-awards/) (2023), and a [Distinguished Master’s Thesis Research Award 🎓 ](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/ece-department-2021-2022-outstanding-student-awards-announced/) (2022) at UCLA. I also held research internships at [Google Labs](https://research.google/) and [Snap Research](https://www.snap.com/en-US).
